## Wireframes
I created the wireframes for Awesome Quiz using Figma, designing frames specifically for a full-width display. The final website deviates slightly from the original wireframes, reflecting adjustments made during the development proces.

### JavaScript
During the development of this application, I encountered numerous bugs in the JavaScript code. Several buttons did not function as intended, and unfortunately, I don't have any images to document these issues. Another challenge was that the questions were not properly shuffled when the "pagy agai" button was pressed. I worked diligently to address these issues, but regrettably, I lack visual references to showcase them.

# Deployment
To deploy github, follow these steps:

    Navigate to the GitHub repository for Your Project Name and go to the Settings tab.

    In the Settings menu, find the Pages tab on the left-hand side.

    Under the Source section, select the branch you want to deploy, typically the main or master branch.

    Click Save.

    Once the selected branch has been chosen, the page will be automatically refreshed, and you'll see a detailed ribbon display indicating the successful deployment.

Now, your project, Your Project Name, should be accessible on GitHub Pages!

Note: It might take a few moments for the changes to take effect, and for your site to become live.

- Sign in to your GitHub account and find the desid repository.
- On the right side of the page, adjacent to the repository name, there is a 'Fork' button. Click on this button to generate a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
